# Greetings there! My name's Garrett, nice to meet you :)

I have been writting software for about 7 years and have no formal education. My
developer journey started with a really crappy Python book. These days I am the
most familiar with Rust, C#, and C but I have a fair amount of knowledge pertaining
to many other languages. I have a specific interest in compilers/language design
and a while back I wrote a rather poor quality compiler frontend for a custom
language with similar semantics to C. Due to a general annoyance with most text
editors I am in the process of writting a custom general purpose plain text and
code editor. My biggest project thus far has been SkyOfSteel, a multiplayer
first-person sandbox game of which development has halted. There are a small handful
of FOSS projecs which I regularly contribute to, free time allowing.

I hold the viewpoint that software development is a craft. That means that we as
developers are craftspeople and should strive to continuously improve at our craft.
Perhaps this stems from my perfectionist tendencies but it is a very important
goal to me to always be learning and producing better software.

Crappy software sucks, let's make less crappy software.
